# The OpenMessaging Benchmark Framework

This repository houses user-friendly, cloud-ready benchmarking suites for the following messaging platforms:

* [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org)
* [Apache RocketMQ](https://rocketmq.apache.org)
* [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/)
* [Apache Pulsar](https://pulsar.apache.org)
* [NATS Streaming](https://nats.io/)

> For details, refer to [official documentation](http://openmessaging.cloud/docs/benchmarks/).

## The Full Benchmark Report
Our benchmark repeated Confluentâ€™s original tests with the appropriate corrections and included all the durability levels supported by Pulsar and Kafka. As a result, we were able to compare throughput and latency at equivalent levels of durability. In addition, we benchmarked new performance factors and conditions and emulated real-world use cases.
